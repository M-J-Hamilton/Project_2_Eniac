The main purpose of the presentation is to recommend whether or not the company should offer discounts on products. 
The presentation should show how the products were categorised and support the decision put forward plus any recommendations.

	Various questions were asked of the data through pandas on Colab.
	Most of the queries were supported through the use of charts, pie, line, histogram and bar types were all utilised.
	Graphics were copied to the presentation
	Research was undertaken to bring a more personable angle to the presentation.

### Presentation
Working in a group of four the presentation was assembled in google shared workspace, and images sourced to support the story.
Narrative and charts were added before review and final amendments. 
Each member presented a section of the presentation for the final task.
